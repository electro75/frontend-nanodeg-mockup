What new skills have you learned?
A. I think my basic Fundamentals of html are quite srong now. I have learnt a lot of new html tags which can do different 
things, which is quite awesome.

What has been easy? What has been difficult?
A. I would like to answer these two questions at once.
As a beginner in programming when i tried to learn through other sources all at once, I found all of it to be very complicated
and confusing. But the way Cameron explains the concepts makes them really very easy to understande and hence grasp.

How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
A. I have used the developer.mozilla documentation very helpful. And my mentor Rishabh has also been great help.
